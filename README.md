# UFO_Finder
Module 12 Challenge

## Purpose
The purpose of this was to create a site where the UFO sightings could be reviewed and analyzed via filtering based off a number of criteria.

## Results
With the ability to filter our data a user could look to determine which states or cities have the most sightings, or even try to determine if one state/city is continuing to see the same type of UFO (via the shape filter) over time (date filter).

## Summary
One drawback I noted was the inability to search the comments column for key words. In my opionion that should be added to help filter through the data. Additonally, I would like to see the ability to filter down to a specific time period as opposed to just one date (i.e. January to March).
